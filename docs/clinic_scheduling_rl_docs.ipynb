Can seed scheduled arrivals from the booking planner.\n\n### Additions over V1\n- **Multi-provider**: `num_providers` servers; each minute decrements busy timers.\n- **Variable service**: `_service_duration()` draws around mean (approx lognormal).\n- **Action masking**: mask invalid actions if no eligible patient or no free providers.\n- **Seeding**: `seeded_schedule=[(patient_id, start_minute), ...]` to reflect booked times.\n\n### Observation\n- minute slot, walk-in queue length, late list length, scheduled remaining, free providers, and 3 mask bits.\n\n### Actions\nSame as V1 (0 scheduled, 1 walk-in, 2 late recall) but validated by mask.\n\n### Reward\nSimilar to V1; scaled by number served in a minute; end-of-day penalty for unserved scheduled.\n\n### Logs\n`served_log` records id, served minute, arrival time, walk-in flag, late flag, wait time."
